# Deadline App

"Whiterose was right. We run from one deadline to the next" - Mr.Robot

Deadline is a open source Android mobile app that helps you stay on top of your deadlines. With Deadline, you can easily create and track deadlines for all of your important events, from birthdays and parties to work projects and errands.

**Deadline might lack features you want, but hey, you can create issue and work on it!**

### Workflow:

1. Browse open issues.
2. Choose an issue that you understand and like.
3. Comment **`I'm on it`** on the issue.

### Tech stack
- 100% Kotlin
- 100% Jetpack compose
- MVVM architecture (Circuit inspired)
